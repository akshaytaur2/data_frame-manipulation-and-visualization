# data_frame-manipulation-and-visualization
The project was to allow users to load a DataFrame from a CSV file, clean the data in various ways, display statistics, and create visualizations.
When the program runs, the user will see an introductory message:
Welcome to The DataFrame Statistician!.

After the welcome message, the user is presented with the following menu:
Please choose from the following options: 
1 – Load data from a file 
2 – View data 
3 – Clean data 
4 – Analyse data
5 – Visualise data 
6 - Save data to a file 
7 - Quit

Option 7 will exit the program; every other option will do some task and then display the menu again until the user chooses 7 from this menu.
